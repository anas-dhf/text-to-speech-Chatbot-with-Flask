# Text-to-Speech Chatbot with Flask Interface

This project is an advanced version of the previous Chatbot I made (you can find it on this Github) and here are the added features:

- Text-to-Speech functionalities
- Flask Interface
- No limitations

It's based on the Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro - to be precise).
